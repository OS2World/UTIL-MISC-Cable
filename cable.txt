Cable 1.1
===========================================
This software is released under GPL license.

Cable is a small program written taking portions of code from GenMac utilities samples
and from XWP. It has been written to allow automatic start of XWLan when the lan cable
is not connected to your computer. This program will only work with drivers that
support the appropriate IOCtl calls.

Use is quite simple:

	CABLE DriverName|DeviceNumber [ExeName]

Where DeviceNumber is the number of your LAN card in GenMac drivers (so it does not
necessarily follow the same order used by OS/2, e.g. 0 is not always lan0).
On my notebook I use

	cable 0 E:\bin\xwlan\xcenter\wlanstat.exe

You can also specify a driver name e.g. NVETH$ instead of a GenMac device number.

You can omit the ExeName to show current card status: e.g.

	cable 0

might show

	Lan-Number      : lan2
	LinkSpeed       : 100 [Mbit/s]
	LinkStatus      : CONNECTED


Installation
------------
Put cable.exe on your path and execute it from startup.cmd.
